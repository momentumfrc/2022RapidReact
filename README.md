# 2022 Rapid React [![CI Status](https://github.com/momentumfrc/2022RapidReact/workflows/Java%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/momentumfrc/2022RapidReact/actions) [![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=momentumfrc_2022RapidReact&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=momentumfrc_2022RapidReact)

The official repository for Team 4999 Momentum Robotics and 2022 FIRST Robotics Competition: RAPID REACT.

### Code Structure
`com.momentum4999.robot` - Intended to be minimal, readable, accessible to less experienced programmers, and easily extensible with low boilerplate
`com.momentum4999.components` - Intended to house abstractions for more complicated code, ideally representing separate components of the robot without cluttering their respective subsystem classes
